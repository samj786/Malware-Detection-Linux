# Infectious Virus Detection System 
A Linux process scanner with TUI (Text User Interface) that monitors running processes and checks them against a malware signature database. The scanner computes SHA-256 process executables for comparison and provides real-time system monitoring capabilities.

## Features

- Interactive text-based user interface using ncurses
- Real-time process monitoring and scanning
- SHA-256 computation for process executables
- Binary search implementation for efficient malware database lookups
- Color-coded process risk levels
- Multi-threaded hash checking for improved performance
- Support for large malware signature databases

## Prerequisites

The following libraries and tools are required to build and run the scanner:

```bash
# Core build requirements
gcc
make
libncurses-dev
libssl-dev

# For fuzzy hash computation
ssdeep
```

## Building

To compile the project, run:

```bash
gcc -o process_scanner scanner_ui.c processes.c hash_checker.c -lncurses -lcrypto -pthread
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a malware signature database file named `full_sorted_file.csv` in the same directory as the executable. The database should have the following format:
   ```
   hash,filename,file_type,mime_type,signature
   ```

2. Run the scanner:
   ```bash
   ./process_scanner
   ```

### Controls

- **Up/Down Arrow**: Navigate through the process list
- **Enter**: View detailed process information
- **r**: Rescan processes
- **q**: Quit the application

## Display Information

The scanner displays the following information for each process:
- Process ID (PID)
- Process Name
- Process State
- Risk Level (Normal/Suspicious)

Suspicious processes are highlighted in red, while normal processes are shown in green.

## Implementation Details

The scanner consists of several key components:

### Process Information Collection (`processes.c`)
- Reads process information from `/proc`
- Computes SHA-256 and fuzzy hashes of process executables
- Collects process states, memory usage, and other metrics

### Hash Checking (`hash_checker.c`)
- Implements efficient binary search for hash lookup
- Supports large malware signature databases
- Multi-threaded hash checking for better performance

### User Interface (`scanner_ui.c`)
- ncurses-based TUI implementation
- Real-time process list updates
- Color-coded risk levels
- Status bar with system information

## Security Considerations

- Requires root privileges to access certain process information
- Handle malware signature database with appropriate security measures
- Keep the signature database up-to-date for effective detection

## Limitations

- Only works on Linux systems
- Requires read access to process executables
- Performance may vary with large numbers of processes
- Database must be pre-sorted for binary search functionality
